They say starting is the hardest part. My initial idea for this blog is to post the things I learned during the day and the resources that helped me learn them.

###Here is what I learned today:

1. You can host a blog on Github using [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/). There is a framework called [Octopress](http://octopress.org) to help make things easy. I followed the documentation for [initial setup](http://octopress.org/docs/setup/) and launched this blog. 

2. Deploying the changes for the blog can be done with the following steps:

	Generate the blog with

	```
	rake generate
	```

	Deploy

	```
	rake deploy
	```

	Commit the source for the blog.

	```
	git add .
	git commit -m 'your message'
	git push origin source
	``` 

3. You can preview changes to the blog before deploying using the following

	```
	rake preview
	```
